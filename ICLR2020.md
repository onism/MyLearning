6. DeFINE: Deep Factorized Input Token Embeddings for Neural Sequence Modeling

DeFINE uses a deep, hierarchical, sparse network with new skip connections to learn better word embeddings efficiently.

With DeFINE, Transformer-XL learns input (embedding) and output (classification) representations in low n-dimensional space rather than high m-dimensional space, thus reducing parameters significantly while having a minimal impact on the performance.

# Generative models 

1. Generative Models for Effective ML on Private, Decentralized Datasets

Generative Models + Federated Learning + Differential Privacy gives data scientists a way to analyze private, decentralized data (e.g., on mobile devices) where direct inspection is prohibited.
