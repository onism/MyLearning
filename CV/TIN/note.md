# Traditional method inspired deep neural network for edge detection

We simplify the network architecture to include Feature Extractor, Enrichment, and Summarizer, which roughly correspond to gradient, low pass filter, and pixel connection in the traditional edge detection schemes. 

## Feature Extractor

We start from a simple feature extractor, which is a 3 \times 3 CNN. 

## Enrichment component

--- > conv(16, 32, 3) ---> conv(32, 32, 3) ----> conv(32,32,3) --->conv(32,32,3)
        |                    |                      |                   |
        |                    |                      |                   |
        |____________________|______________________|________________Rich Feature                 

In a traditional edge detector, low pass filters and the other more complicated schemes are oftern used to remove the noise or tiny/isolated edge candidates. We use  dilated conv to build multiple scale filtering. The dilated conv can capture a larger receptive field with fewer parameters.  

## Summarizer
The last module tries to summarize the features generated by the Enrichment modules and to produce the final edges. We use eight 1\times 1 CNN layers together with a sigmoid activation function.

## Loss function
We comptue the loss of each pixel prediction with repsect to the ground truth as follows

## Post-processing
We use multi-scale testing and NMS as our post-processing.  
First, we resize the input image to three different resolutions, 0.5x,1x and 1.5x, then feed them into the network.
